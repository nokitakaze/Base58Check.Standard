Base58Check is a C# implementation of [Base58 Checked Encoding](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding), based on a [public domain Gist](https://gist.github.com/CodesInChaos/3175971) by @CodesInChaos.

In short, Base58 is a encoding algorithm similar to Base64, removing certain characters that cause issues with URLs, and cause confusion because of how similar they look in certain fonts. Base58Check adds a 4 byte checksum to validate that the data hasn't been altered in transmission. This checksum isn't suitable to perform cryptographic validation, but is does detect accidental corruption.

## Installation

[NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NokitaKaze.Base58Check/)

## Public Interface

* **`Base58Check.Encode(byte[])`** - Encodes data with a 4-byte checksum
* **`Base58Check.Decode(string)`** - Decodes data in Base58Check format (with 4 byte checksum)
* **`Base58Check.EncodePlain(byte[])`** - Encodes data in plain Base58, without any checksum
* **`Base58Check.DecodePlain(string)`** - Decodes data in plain Base58, without any checksum

The `Encode*` methods both expect a byte array of arbitrary length; as the entire payload to encode must be loaded into memory, an `OutOfMemoryException` may be thrown for large payloads. The `Decode*` methods will throw a `FormatException` if the string passed in isn't in a valid Base58 format; the `Decode` method will also throw the `FormatException` if the checksum verification fails.
